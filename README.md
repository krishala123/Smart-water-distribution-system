# 💧 Smart Water Distribution System 

This is a **C++ project** that simulates a smart water distribution system.  
It models water sources, seasonal rainfall, and daily consumption to raise awareness about **water scarcity** and promote **sustainable water management**.  

---

## 📌 Introduction
Water scarcity is a serious global issue. Effective water management is essential for ensuring fair distribution and preventing shortages.  
This project demonstrates how simulation can be used to model water sources, consumption, and rainfall in order to better understand real-world challenges.

## 🚀 Features
- Models water sources with population and storage capacity  
- Seasonal rainfall simulation (Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter)  
- Tracks daily water consumption  
- Alerts when tank capacity drops below 10%  
- Console-based graphical tank progress bar  
- Saves simulation data into a text file

## 🖥️ How to Run Locally

1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/krishala123/Smart-water-distribution-system.git
   cd Smart-water-distribution-system
   
---

2. **Compile the program**
    ```bash
   g++ main.cpp -o water_simulation

  ---

3. **Run the simulation**
    ```bash
    ./water_simulation

---

   


## 🖥️ Sample Output

- 📅 Simulating a new day...
- ☀ Summer heat and dry spells!
- 🌧 Tank1 received 12L of rainfall
- 🚰 40L used in CityA. Remaining: 72L
- 🚨 ALERT: Tank below 10% capacity
